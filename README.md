# PSO-ANN
Code for Bachelor's thesis project (Capstone - Jonas van der Ham.pdf) examining the scalability of PSO for ANN training.  

Code for Backpropagation is mostly from: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/376312/mnist-digit-recognition-what-is-the-best-we-can-get-with-a-fully-connected-nn-o  
Code for PSO is from: https://github.com/kuhess/pso-ann  

For my research functionality is added and the code is modified to work on the full MNIST dataset.  
To use MNIST download:  
[The MNIST training-set](https://www.python-course.eu/data/mnist/mnist_train.csv)  
[The MNIST test-set](https://www.python-course.eu/data/mnist/mnist_test.csv)  

Put them in the directory and run `prep_MNIST_data.py` to create the numpy binaries which are used in the model.
